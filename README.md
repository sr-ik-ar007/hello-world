# hello-world
My first repository


Hey There Muggles...!

Srikar here... I'm new to GitHub, so this is my first edit kinda thing I'd be doing for now.

I like to watch TV series, and I'm not pretty good at coding, but I want to. I can try to use my free time for studying etcetera, but I don't know why I choose to waste my time.

Might be not too much about me, but I feel I typed much enough.. (-;
